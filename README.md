# Blinkit-DB
1) PROBLEM STATEMENT

In the fast-paced world of online grocery delivery, data-driven decision-making is critical for operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. 
Blinkit, a rapid delivery platform, generates vast amounts of transactional, operational, and customer data daily. However, without a centralized, 
interactive dashboard, key insights remain siloed and difficult to act upon.This project aims to develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for Blinkit 
that visualizes essential business metrics—including sales trends, product performance, customer behavior, and order fulfillment—enabling stakeholders 
to make informed decisions quickly. By transforming raw Excel-based data into dynamic visualizations, this dashboard serves as a strategic tool for business 
analysis, performance tracking, and identifying areas for improvement.
